Sample: Mandelbrot
Minimum spec: SM 1.0

This sample uses CUDA to compute and display the Mandelbrot or Julia sets interactively. It also illustrates the use of "double single" arithmetic to improve precision when zooming a long way into the pattern. This sample use double precision hardware if a GT200 class GPU is present.  Thanks to Mark Granger of NewTek who submitted this code sample.!
